# Hi there 👋 I'm Andrew Patterson

Welcome to my GitHub! This is where I showcase small personal projects to demonstrate my coding skills. While I focus on simple, manageable projects, these are great examples of my capabilities in web development and programming.
Feel free to use any of these without attribution. I do this for fun.

## 🚀 Skills & Tools
- **Languages:** Java, JavaScript, SQL, HTML, CSS
- **Platforms & Tools:** Linux, Git, Command Line, Shell Scripting
- **Web Development:** Front-end with HTML/CSS/JavaScript, Back-end with SQL, Linux server management

## 🛠️ Projects Overview
Here are some small projects that I’ve created to showcase my programming knowledge:

- **D&D encounter generator**: Python project to create a random dungeon encounter in my campaigns

Each of these projects is designed to be simple, but they demonstrate core concepts in programming and web development.

## 🌱 What I'm Currently Working On
- Enhancing my Java skills 
- Building more personal projects to refine my **Java** and **Python** capabilities.
